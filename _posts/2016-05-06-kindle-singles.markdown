Think about yourself good? Dumb question! Who doesn't.

If you think publishing your book yourself is too hard, seeking publishers' attention is too fishy, or you simply believe your books or stories don't get the chance to be presented in front of readers, there is one more way you can try --- Amazon Kindle Singles.

Here is a challenger in front of both authors and publishers. We are now living in an age where content is abundant. So, we are not living in an age where readers would flock to new books. Readers only have limited time and energy. They want to spend their time on quality books. As a result, traditional publishers finally got a moment of respite they longed for. Is Amazon happy? Noooo. Amazon Kindle gives readers excessive choices, too much than they can comfortable handle. Thus we have Amazon Kindle Singles.

> Kindle Singles is here to offer a vast spectrum of reporting, essays, memoirs, narratives, and short stories presented to educate, entertain, excite, and inform. Our writers take you places you can't get to any other way, on journeys of fact and fiction that share these common threads: they're the highest-quality work we can find, and at a length best suited to the ideas they present.

Books in Kindle Singles are short. This fit readers who already adapted to short reading sessions, 10 minutes, 15 minutes, etc. It is also a good fit for authors who have good short story, or don't have time or confidant to handle a novel.

> Kindle Singles are typically between 5,000 and 30,000 words.

So, you could finish your story within a few days up to a few weeks, and give it a try.

It is "highest-quality work". You can not simply finish your book and then put it into Kindle Store. You need to go through a process pretty much like the traditional approach. You send a copy to Amazon. A editor will review your script and decide a Yea or Neh. It is a E-book. So, it is fast. It still sells the same way as other Kindle books. The only different is, Kindle Singles is less crowded. It will be this way for the time to come. Supposedly, readers would be more willing to buy books from Kindle Singles since it comes with some sort of guarantee.

How many of us had a good story, but simply lacked the time to finish it up? Now, it is a good chance for you to dig into old folders, hard drivers, diaries, and give it a try. 

It is short. So, you wouldn't be too disappointed if you get a Nay.

It has an review process. So, once you pass, you know you are good. More importantly, readers know that too.

If nobody reads your stories, there is no different between spending two years on it, or two days on it. So, go short, dream big.
