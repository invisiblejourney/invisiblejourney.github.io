A story covers both space and time. Assembling story strickly in timely order works, for chronicles at least. I want to find the right moment to make this story right into the point without having pages that can scare off readers.

How about this as the first sentence of the coming book.

*Under the water, deep into the oceans, where light can not reach, there are monsters cutting through the darkest place on Earth. Each carries matter that could unleash the energy that powers the Sun, wipe human existance from this planet.*
