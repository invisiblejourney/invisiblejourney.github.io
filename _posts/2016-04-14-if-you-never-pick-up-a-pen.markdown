More precisely, it should be: *If you never type a character, you will never finish a word.*

Those scenes have been inside my mind for a very long time.
It is like a soup. Yes, the longer you keep it in a slow cooker, the better it tastes.
Except that, first, before it burns; second, before the dinner is done.
