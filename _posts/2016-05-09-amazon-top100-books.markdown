[Amazon Best Sellers in Books](http://www.amazon.com/best-sellers-books-Amazon/zgbs/books/) lists top selling books. Updated hourly. 

Do you ever wonder which category is the hottest? Or how books distributed in different categories? I did. I went extra mile to assemble the top 100 books on May 5 into their relative categories, and made a nice chart during the weekend.

A few note:

- Data is from Amazon.com. It covers United States in that particular day. Different region has different top 100.
- A book almost always belongs to more than one category. Each category increases by one.
- This chart here only contains 3 layers for browsing. You can download a 5-layer version by clicking links below.
- Top 100 is changing. Take this into account.
- Book #1 to #100 both counted as one for each of their residing category. So, don't directly compare percentage with sales income.
