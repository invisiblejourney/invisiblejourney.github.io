GitHub is well known among software developers. So is GitHub Pages, a FREE service for GitHubers to host and publish their static webpages.

Professional book writers care less about FREE nor GitHub Pages. But for writers writing books for pleasure and eager to share with others, FREE and GitHub Pages make a dramatic different.

There are a few ways to share your books with readers. You can print it and show them. It is not something we normally do. But it has its merits. You can also email to selected a few. Considering your books are still under construction, above approaches are troublesome, and will consume your passion soon than you could grow.

Using free blog services, online writing websites, or going further to setup your own website to host your content?

While those methods do provide the benefit of reaching wider reader groups, there are noticeable disadvantages. Free blog services usually come with Ads, you know, the thing that most people like, a lot. Also, you don't have full control of your content. While those blog sites may share the same goal of attracting more readers, they probably care less about the user interface for you to create content. Online writing sites usueally require registration. It is just another extra barrier you don't want standing in between you and your readers.
