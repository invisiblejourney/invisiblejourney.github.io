I haven't written in here for about a month. Why? It turned out that a person can only write a certain amount a day. It is pretty much like writing code for software. The different is, writing code is much less productive than writing fictions.

Anyway, I spent my spare time recently mostly on this book. It is the first book in "The Invisible Journey" book series.

It is short, just slightly more than 11,000 words. I considered 10,000 as a reasonable size. Even at low speed, 300 words/minutes, it still takes only about half hour to finish. It is still longer than what people would spend on reading a blog post. But when you pick up a book, you would naturally accept the fact that it would take longer than a web page, or an article.

A shorter book couldn't justify a physical printed book. But since this is for Kindle, that is not a concern. More specifically, this is targeting Kindle Singles where books are expected to be around 5000 to 30000 words.

During the writing, it does pose some pressures to certain chapters. But keeping a book slim is a good cause. It is worth it.

It has been submitted to Kindle Singles. It says the waiting period would be 6 weeks. But I expect the actual review period might be shorter than that.
