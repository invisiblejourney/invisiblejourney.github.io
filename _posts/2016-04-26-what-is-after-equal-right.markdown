Yesterday, during a discussion, I mentioned this. Right now, we recognize that human should have equal rights. Man and woman, tall or short, black or white, or yellow, rich or poor, etc.

If you told people "black has equal right as white" before the Civil War in southern states, at the best, people would laugh at you if they are not in the mood of shooting someone. If you shouted "king and queen are just normal people like us" in UK a few hundred years ago, you probably would find youself in prison cell for quite some time assuming you could out-live whatever sentence you'd get. You could still expect the same treatment today in some countries. A poor Thai man faces jail for insulting, not the king directly, the king's dog.

So, our view of rights is changing and improving---we believe.

Now comes the interesting question.

Should cats have their rights too? Or dogs? Or cows? Or chickens? 

Right now, we think, "they don't have opinions, they are animal." But they have a brain, like us, less sophisticated, but the fundamental mechanism is alike. If we can invent an equipment that can detect their opinions, should we also put their rights into our agenda of discussions?
