Never been in history books are vast and accessible. Yet finding a book that matches is still hard. Being fed with stories that had been told again and again with similar fiction setup, the moment will come when you can not take more.

An challange that get in everyone's way is how can we do better?

Obstacle may vanish. The question is are we reaching our full potential. This series is set up to explore it.
