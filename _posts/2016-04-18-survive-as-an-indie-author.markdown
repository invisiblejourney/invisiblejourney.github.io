It is never been easier to be an indie author. 
You can get your book published all by yourself to multiple channels, physical and digital, within a week, reaching millions.
But make no mistake! Possibility doesn't equal to reality. 
Your book may be very well sitting in Kindle Store, Apple Book Store, or Google Book Store for weeks without a single copy sold.

How to cope with this huge gap between potential and fact?

If you had the writing skill, but lacked the idea that kept you from sleeping in the night, 
then there are full-time paid jobs that require writing skills, marketing, documentation, you name it.
Writing a book isn't the only way you can cash your skill. 

If you believed you just had the brilliant idea, a magnificent plot, then don't rush to hand in your resignation yet.
You can reach some publishers to see if they see your idea fits.
You can also write your book as a personal interest, a getaway from your daily routine.

How many of us can close our eyes, say "I am a talented writer."
and open our eyes without the feeling of a 5-year-old facing parents with creams from the forbidden cake around his/her mouth?
So, even the book isn't widely recognized, it is not as serious as wasting a rare intellectual resource of mankind.
The most important question is, "Was I having fun doing it?" If the answer is Yes, then recognition and extra revenue are extra perks.

Still with me? Good. Let's get into the bright side.

Ever got a D from teacher after you handed in a hard-crafted essay? Well, those days are gone. Nobody will be judging you.
If you are targeting a certain group readers, you can release it without worrying too much about the picky editors between you and your readers.

As an adult, you wouldn't expect publishers are working day and night for the benefit of their authors, would you? 
The fact is, publishers spend most of their marketing efforts on their star authors.
They still want to draw some new blood into their portfolio of authors.
But they definitely spend less time and money on them than those authors would expect.
You would think they have their magic somehow to make your book popular or successful. 
In fact, they do. Their reputation and channels can put your books in more places.
But to attract readers, they really don't have much in their sleeve.
Unless you just want to write a book and then be done with it,
building a loyal group of readers are more important than simply putting your book in the corner of a few libraries.
You can do better, with some efforts to overcome the initial fraction of course.

Not everyone goes to McDonald's because they love the hamburgers.
They may simply hungry, and not knowing there are other choices.
If you like your book, then there are readers that love it as much as you do. You simply need to let them know.

Social media, Facebook, Twitter, Google+, Instgram, ..., can be used to spread your book.
It shouldn't be hard to figure out by yourself by simply checking what others are doing.

If you already have your book portfolio built up, then you can consider paid ads.
Before that you should first figure out a way to measure the effectiveness of the spending.
Don't throw money in hopes that it will do you good. If you expect spending $5,000 will lead to 5000 copies sold, 
spend $1,000 first, measure the result, and then adjust expectation and next spending accordingly.

I don't want to wear you out by repeating a lot of awesome tutorials easily accessible just by searching.
Just remember two things: using social media as a way to promote your books, and build reader base;
don't spend money unless you have a way to tell how effective the spending is.
